Last week [Vaughn Vernon][1] teased/announced [Number 9][2] which he proposes as an alternative to Akka's AtLeastOnceDelivery.  One interesting difference
is the use of the Message Journal to store unconfirmed messages.  This design is a siginificant departure from Akka's AtLeastOnceDelivery.

> You see, AtLeastOnceDelivery doesnâ€™t by default support message persistent storage, and actually only 
> offers any resemblance to it when your actor is given a chance to store a snapshot of its current state. 
> Since a snapshot is not offered for every message you send via AtLeastOnceDelivery, a crash could easily 
> render any number of messages undelivered.

Since snapshots are *optional* and in most cases *periodic* based on either message throughput or elapsed time, you should
count on losing messages at some point.

In addition to being responsible for keeping track of unconfirmed messages, AtLeastOnceDelivery also makes each Entity responsible for attempting redelivery of 
its own messages and tracking delivery confirmations.  *Number 9* moves the redelivery task to a separate actor named Redeliverer.  This is an interesing idea
that appears to fix one issue I've encountered with AtLeastOnceDelivery and its use of the *redeliveryTick*.

Each actor using AtLeastOnceDelivery sets up a redeliveryTick system timer to trigger a check for unconfirmed messages.  This timer fires even when the actor has no 
unconfirmed messages.  The tick has the side effect of making receiveTimeout unusable.  On a recent project that used the cluster sharding extension with passivation support,
this conflict prevented actors from passivating correctly.  Actors using AtLeastOnceDelivery with *no* unconfirmed messages would refuse to passivate as long as they 
were receiving the redeliveryTick.

The Redeliverer looks to move this functionality out of the entities which should allow sharding/passivation to work as designed.

While making these departures from the current implementation, it's important to remember that *Number 9* is an alternative implementation of at-least-once.

> Since Number 9 provides an at-least-once delivery mechanism, you will likely want to take whatever design steps are necessary to make the 
> [the processor] an Idempotent Receiver. This requirement will be more or less challenging depending on the state machine needed by the actor.

Because exactly-once [is not what you want][3].

From what's been shared so far *Number 9* sounds like a good approach to fixing some of the issues with AtLeastOnceDelivery.  The only drawback I see at this point
is that it's unreleased and I'd really love to take a look at the code.  I'll be watching this tool for future articles and releases.
